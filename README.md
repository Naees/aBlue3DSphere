# aBlue3DSphere
A 3D sphere rotating with figures

This code uses the Matplotlib library to create a 3D figure and plot a sphere on it. The sphere is created using the parametric equations for a sphere, with the x, y, and z coordinates of the sphere defined as functions of two parameters, u and v. The outer() function is used to generate the coordinates of the sphere.

After creating the sphere, the code uses a for loop to rotate the sphere by incrementing the viewing angle. The view_init() function sets the elevation and azimuthal angles, and the angle variable is used to increment the azimuthal angle in the loop.

The plt.draw() and plt.pause(.001) is to update the plot each time the angle changes and pause for a very short time. This creates the animation of the sphere rotating.

This is just a simple example of how to create a 3D sphere and rotate it using Python. This approach can be used to create more complex animations, or to create interactive visualizations of 3D data.
